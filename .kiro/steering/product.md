# Ghostagotchi Product Overview

Ghostagotchi is a cross-platform AI-powered virtual ghost pet application combining mobile AR, web interactivity, and AI-driven chat. Built for the Kiroween hackathon, it demonstrates the "Frankenstein" category by stitching together disparate technologies into one cohesive experience.

## Core Concept

Users adopt a friendly ghost as a pet, care for it Tamagotchi-style, and interact via natural language conversations. The ghost has basic needs (hunger, mood) that users must manage, fostering ongoing engagement.

## Key Features

- **AR Ghost Pet (iOS)**: Immersive augmented reality experience using ARKit where the ghost appears in the user's real environment
- **AI Companion**: Natural language conversations powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, giving the ghost a unique personality (friendly with a playful spooky twist)
- **Cross-Platform**: Seamless access via iOS app (immersive AR) and web dashboard (broad accessibility)
- **Real-Time Sync**: Instant state synchronization across all devices using Supabase Realtime
- **Social Features**: Public leaderboard ranking ghosts by level and stats, fostering community and friendly competition

## Target Users

- AR enthusiasts and mobile gamers who enjoy virtual pet games
- Fans of AI chatbots and virtual companions
- Tech community and hackathon judges evaluating technical integration
- Casual users accessing via web dashboard

## User Experience

Users can feed their ghost, play with it, chat naturally, and watch it level up. The ghost responds contextually with personality-filled answers. All interactions sync in real-time between iOS and web, ensuring the ghost is "always with you" across any device.

## Development Philosophy

Built using Kiro's AI-powered development environment with spec-driven development, agent hooks, steering documents, and Model Context Protocol to accelerate development while maintaining code quality and consistency.
